Contributing
-------------

Pull requests of all sizes are very much appreciated, below is a quick guide on how you can help:

1. Fork the master branch of this repository

2. Install a local copy of minicron like so: ````bundle```` & ````rake install````

3. Run the tests to be sure everything is working before you begin like so: ````rake spec````

4. Make your changes.

5. With the exception of documentation changes, any changes should ideally have accompanying tests.

6. Submit your pull request!

Where possible I'm trying to adhere to the [Ruby Community Styleguide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide "Ruby Community Styleguide") so please try to do so when making your changes.

Thanks!
